SyncRhythmboxLastFm
===================
Synchronize Rhythmbox with the Last.fm database

Forked from LastfmPlaycount (https://github.com/BramBonne/LastfmPlaycount)


Synopsis
--------

The Last.fm database synchronization plugin for Rhythmbox fetches the currently playing track's information from Last.fm, and updates your Rhythmbox database accordingly.

Will be synchronized the following information:

- Count of reproduction (play count)
- Loved track (rating)
- Date of first reproduction (first seen)
- Date of last reproduction (last played)

- Suggestions? (https://github.com/phms/SyncRhythmboxLastFm/issues)


Installation
------------

To install the plugin for the current user only, run the install script with
  ./install.sh

To install system-wide (for all users), run this script as root with
  sudo ./install.sh


How to enable
-------------

After installing the plugin in one of the two ways mentioned above, start up Rhythmbox, and head over to the "Edit > Plugins" menu. Check the box next to "Sync Rhythmbox Last.Fm".
Also make sure that you also have the regular "Last.fm" plugin enabled, since your Last.fm credentials stored in this plugin are used by the Last.fm playcount synchronization plugin to get the correct playcounts.


Tips and Tricks
---------------

With the combination of plays counts and the date of first play, it is possible  to create an automatic playlist to find the songs less played in your library.
Probably, these songs aren't very nice...

To create this playlist, in "New Automatic Playlist" use this following rules:

- Time Added to Library > not in last > 50 > weeks
- Play Count > at most > 4
- Play count > at least > 1
